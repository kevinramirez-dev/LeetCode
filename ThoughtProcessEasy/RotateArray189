Instructions:
    - Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.
Thought process:
    - The goal of this question is to rotate integers from one side of the array to the opposite side by shifting
    the numbers to the right.
        - Variable "k" will indicate the amount of times that the array will be shifted
        - It is important to note that the integers will be in incremental order
    - A good way to think about this problem is to relate it to the real world.
        - When a new case of bread in a store is being stocked, the old bread must be shifted to the front of the
        shelf.
        - The new bread will be placed in the back, this is to ensure that the merchandise doesn't go bad and it doesn't
        cause any losses profit.

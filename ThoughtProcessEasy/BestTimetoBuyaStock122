INstructions:
    - You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

      On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any
      time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

      Find and return the maximum profit you can achieve.


Thought Process:
    In this case rather than returning the day where the mac profit is found, it asks us to return the maximum profit that
    we will make if we trade every other day.

    - Lets try and loop through the array, since the "ith" day starts at one we must state so in the loop.
    - Campare the original price to prices[i-1]

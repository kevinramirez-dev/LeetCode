Instructions:
    - You are given an integer array nums. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element
    in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

    Return true if you can reach the last index, or false otherwise.

Thought Process:
    - I want to apprach this like the airplane game, at each square drawn in the ground I will move that amount of steps
        - The only thing that can stop me here is an integer 0
